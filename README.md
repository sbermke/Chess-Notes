# Chess-Notes

Here I'm going to take some notes on how to play chess in nice markdown format.
I might include some really cool chess models or something like that.
I wonder if it will be cool or not, but I hope so!

```chess
fen: r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 1
arrows: f3->e5 b5->c6
squares: g5 f7
```
